This is a tool to extract useful information from given record files. It does
self-check the validity of the uploaded data and able to inform devloper's when
the data is not qualified, and reduce the size of uploaded data significantly.

TODO (Liu Jie):
* Validate the data file, refer to cyber_info especially about the header?
* Develop algorithm to extract useful information (JPG, PCD, Binary data)
* Cloud support
* Use GZIP format by default, maybe we should consider XZ to archieve high
  compression ratio. However, LZMA has problem of compatibility between
  Python2.x and Python3.x.
